## How to View the Project
- [View the deployed website] https://saraelizalde.github.io/Granny-s-Advice/

## Development Process
- I started with Balsamiq to create a wireframe, aiming for a website that feels like a 2000s blog or an old book to trigger nostalgia.

<img src="assets/images/images-readme/basilic.png" alt="Alt text" width="200">

- Initially, I used a background image, knowing it might change based on user interviews. Placing the background was challenging, and after multiple attempts until the end of the project, I settled on: 
background-size: contain;
background-repeat: round;
background-attachment: fixed;
But here was the first vision:

<img src="assets/images/images-readme/first-vision.png" alt="Alt text" width="200">
<img src="assets/images/images-readme/original-palet.png" alt="Alt text" width="200">

- I added a Bootstrap navbar, but struggled with responsiveness, it became too thin on smaller screens. Fixed this by modifying a Bootstrap class. And I made it collapse on medium screens and pushed nav-items to the right.

- Centered the header image to resemble an old-fashioned book.
Added media queries to make the background more visible on large screens and gaps between sections for a balanced look.

<img src="assets/images/images-readme/second-vision-category.png" alt="Alt text" width="200">

- Based on user interviews feedback, I updated:
Background: Changed to a floral pattern.
Color Palette: Switched to green and pinks.
Content Focus: Aligned with the most popular responses.

<img src="assets/images/images-readme/final-palet.png" alt="Alt text" width="200">

- Worked on cards for the main section, ensuring they fit visually with the header.
Struggled with responsiveness but created a section class and set:
 max-width: 90%; And this solved the problem.

- Initially wanted a fixed footer to keep social media links always visible (important for the business plan).
It was too thick, so I opted for a fixed navbar instead for easier navigation on small devices as there is a lot of scrolling.

- Created recipe.html with a slightly different header layout to keep consistency while making it unique.
Added a back button to return to categories but struggled to style it without affecting all links.
Fixed it by specifically targeting : .card .card-body a { }

- After adding content, buttons were misaligned due to varying text sizes.

<img src="assets/images/images-readme/adding-images.png" alt="Alt text" width="200"> Fixed by adding Bootstrap classes: d-flex, flex-column and mt-auto. However, this made the buttons too wide. To fix this: width: auto;
align-self: center;

- Realized that recipe cards would be too long on small screens, so I attempted to use Bootstrap collapsible components.
The collapse function worked but expanded all cards at once instead of individually.
Tried multiple JavaScript and Bootstrap classes solutions but couldn't get an accordion effect. Decided to leave it as is and revisit when I improve my JavaScript skills.

- Created cards without buttons for other pages. Researched content using ChatGPT & the internet. Struggled to find aesthetic images that fit the page’s vibe without being heavy to load on the screen, which ended up being the biggest performance problem.

- Added shadows to cards and sections for a better visual effect.
Initially struggled but ended up using Bootstrap.

- Clicking the navbar internal link to the category section caused the fixed navbar to hide the section title.
Tried margin and padding fixes, but they affected the page layout.
Tried scroll-margin-top but couldn’t override some Bootstrap’s styles somewhere.
So I endend up asking ChatGPT for JavaScript help, and the script worked only on the homepage but not when navigating from another page.
Will revisit once I have more JavaScript experience.

- Found an awkward two-to-one-to-two card layout at 829px width.
Adjusted media queries to widen sections at that breakpoint.

- The site looked too visually busy, so I:
Changed green backgrounds to white for a cleaner look.
Refined images and text alignment.
Added borders to the navbar and footer for better separation.
Added a favicon for branding. <img src="assets/images/images-readme/logo-tab.png" alt="Alt text" width="200"> 

    Updated card design by removing margins around images for a more modern look but keeping rounded corners for a 60s aesthetic across the website.


## Credits
- The JavaScript code for ensuring the Bootstrap mobile navbar collapses when navigating to in-page links comes from Code Institute.
- The JavaScript code for enabling smooth scrolling in index.html was generated with the help of ChatGPT.
- The navbar, the links, the buttons and the cards came from Bootstrap before being updated via CSS.
- Chat GPT helped finding the advices and formulating most of the texts.
